## DVDs
VidCoder can rip DVDs but does not defeat the CSS encryption found in most commercial DVDs. You've got several options to remove the encryption:

* [Passkey Lite](http://www.dvdfab.cn/dvd-decrypter.htm) (Free, removes encryption on the fly)
* [MakeMKV](http://www.makemkv.com/) (Free, requires copying to the hard drive before encoding)
* [DVD Decrypter](http://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk/) (Free, requires copying to the hard drive before encoding, no longer updated)

## Blu-rays
VidCoder does not defeat AACS or BD+ Blu-ray encryption. There are a couple options for removing it:

* [Passkey Lite](http://www.dvdfab.cn/dvd-decrypter.htm) (Free, removes encryption on the fly)
* [MakeMKV](http://www.makemkv.com/) (Currently free in time-limited beta, requires copying to the hard drive before encoding)
