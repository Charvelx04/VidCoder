The Beta release can be installed side-by-side with the stable release. It keeps its presets and settings in a separate store. If you don't have any Beta settings yet, it will copy them from the release settings to get you started.

The Beta will give you new features sooner, but will be at a higher risk of crashes and other bugs. Participation in the Beta helps improve VidCoder, especially if you report any bugs you find.
