{"name":"Vidcoder","tagline":"A Blu-ray, DVD and video file transcoder for Windows.","body":"## Overview\r\nVidCoder is a DVD/Blu-ray ripping and video transcoding application for Windows. It uses [HandBrake](http://handbrake.fr/) as its encoding engine.\r\n\r\nCalling directly into the HandBrake library gives it a more rich UI than the official HandBrake Windows GUI.\r\n\r\n![Main UI screenshot](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Screenshots/main.png)\r\n\r\n{video:url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YEZHZghj0k,type=youtube,width=640,height=360,align=left}\r\n\r\n## Feature List\r\n* Multi-threaded\r\n* MP4, MKV containers\r\n* H.264 encoding with [x264, the world's best video encoder](http://www.compression.ru/video/codec_comparison/h264_2012/)\r\n* Completely integrated encoding pipeline: everything is in one process and no huge intermediate temporary files\r\n* H.265, MPEG-4, MPEG-2, VP8, Theora video\r\n* AAC, MP3, Vorbis, AC3, FLAC audio encoding and AAC/AC3/MP3/DTS/DTS-HD passthrough\r\n* Target bitrate, size or quality for video\r\n* 2-pass encoding\r\n* Decomb, detelecine, deinterlace, rotate, reflect filters\r\n* Batch encoding\r\n* Instant source previews\r\n* Creates small encoded preview clips\r\n* Pause, resume encoding\r\n\r\n![Preview window](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Screenshots/preview.png)\r\n\r\n![Encoding settings](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Screenshots/encoding_settings.png)\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\nYou'll need [.NET 4](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e5ad0459-cbcc-4b4f-97b6-fb17111cf544) (only the client profile is needed). If you don't have it, VidCoder will prompt you to download and install it. If you're on Windows 8 you shouldn't need to install anything; it has .NET 4 pre-installed.\r\n\r\nYou *do not* need to install HandBrake for VidCoder to work.\r\n\r\n**DVDs**\r\nVidCoder can rip DVDs but does not defeat the CSS encryption found in most commercial DVDs. You've got several options to remove the encryption:\r\n* [Passkey Lite](http://www.dvdfab.cn/dvd-decrypter.htm) (Free, removes encryption on the fly)\r\n* [AnyDVD](http://www.slysoft.com/en/anydvd.html) ($89, removes encryption on the fly)\r\n* [MakeMKV](http://www.makemkv.com/) (Free, requires copying to the hard drive before encoding)\r\n* [DVD Decrypter](http://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk/) (Free, requires copying to the hard drive before encoding, no longer updated)\r\n\r\n**Blu-rays**\r\nVidCoder does not defeat AACS or BD+ Blu-ray encryption. There are a few options for removing it:\r\n* [Passkey Lite](http://www.dvdfab.cn/dvd-decrypter.htm) (Free, removes encryption on the fly)\r\n* [AnyDVD HD](http://www.slysoft.com/en/anydvdhd.html) ($152, removes encryption on the fly)\r\n* [MakeMKV](http://www.makemkv.com/) (Currently free in time-limited beta, requires copying to the hard drive before encoding)\r\n\r\n## Reporting Bugs\r\nIf you encounter any bugs with encoding, please see if they happen with the official HandBrake client as well. If the problem is reproducible on HandBrake, submit the issue to them. If it's only VidCoder that has the problem, submit it here.\r\n\r\nAny feedback or bug reports (anything where you'd like to have a discussion or get a response) please put in Discussions or the Issue Tracker. I can't respond to reviews you write. Feel free to write reviews; just be aware that they're not a great way to ask for features or report bugs.\r\n\r\n## Languages\r\n![English](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/english.png) ![Spanish](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/spanish.png) ![German](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/german.png) ![French](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/french.png) ![Italian](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/italian.png) ![Portuguese](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/portuguese.png) ![Brazilian Portuguese](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/portuguese_brazilian.png) ![Czech](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/czech.png) ![Polish](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/polish.png) ![Russian](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/russian.png) ![Chinese Simplified](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/chinese_simplified.png) ![Chinese Traditional](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/chinese_traditional.png) ![Japanese](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/japanese.png) ![Hungarian](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/hungarian.png) ![Basque](http://engy.us/VidCoder/Flags/basque.png)\r\nVidCoder includes English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Polish, Russian, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Japanese, Hungarian and Basque translations.
